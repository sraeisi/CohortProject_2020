# Pharmaceutical Business Application

Today, during a global pandemic like COVID-19, it has never been more evident the importance of reducing both time and cost for the discovery of new vaccines and therapeutic drugs. In this business application, we overview the exponential optimization computing advantage of our research, QC collaborations for future work, market advantages, and key customer demographics and their financial incentives for partnering with our team. 

A repository which explores this more can be found here with key contributions from Mario Guzzi, Skylar Chaney, Alexander Soare and Jake Malliaros.

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise


Overall: Optimization, in application of studying energy of molecules.

- **Task 1 & Task 2**: Optimization problem with exponential speedup: minimized the hidden units and training samples necessary for training the RBM (In the example of Task 2, 201 data points vs 10^30 data points)
- **D-Wave**: Solving the optimization problem on D-Wave resources. Expanding our RBM optimization work as well as efficiently mapping the problem for simulation. This work allows us a starting point for further exploration with D-Wave resources for further computationally complex chemistry problems we want to solve where D-Wave resources may provide an advantage (ex. larger molecules).


## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Applications of optimizing molecular data simulation:
- **Pharmaceutical & Materials Science applications**: optimizing drug and molecule discovery 
    - Advantages for expanding and speeding up drug and molecule discovery R&D:

        - Minimizes the massive R&D costs used to search for novel molecules by exponentially reducing the number of data points necessary for simulations
    - Quantum Computing implementation (future research expansion):
        - Additionally, with more advanced quantum computing hardware, drug development times could be **sped up by 20%** and **drug approval rates could double** using similar molecular simulation optimizations [[BCG, 2019]](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/coming-quantum-leap-computing.aspx)
            - We will have a stake in the quantum advantage by expanding research to be compatible with quantum resources, like our D-Wave optimization work


- Other industries (financial, telecom, energy, etc.) have the potential to benefit from the optimization with further work to effectively map their complex data sets into a Hamiltonian.
